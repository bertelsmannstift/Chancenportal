				<source>The main text of the Content Element is entered here and can be formatted with HTML or a Rich Text Editor.
The field is reused in other Content Element types so changing the type will cause any text to be reused in that new Content Element type.

When you're using this field with the "Text" and "Text &amp; Images" types, the content is normal body text. Each linebreak signifies a new paragraph, you can use the special TYPO3 tag, &amp;lt;LINK&amp;gt;, for making links. You can use many HTML tags but there are limitations depending on your website configuration.
A Rich Text Editor is commonly used to add a visual editing interface for 'Text' and 'Text &amp; Images' Content Elements.

&lt;b&gt;Bullet Lists:&lt;/b&gt;
If the type is "Bullet List" each line in this field is a bullet item.

&lt;b&gt;Tables:&lt;/b&gt;
If the type is "Table" each line represents a table row. Within each line, columns are divided by a vertical bar ('|'). A table row with 3 columns could look like "This is column 1 | Column 2 here | Third column!". The table wizard can also be used for creating tables and is much easier than hand coding them.</source>
			<target state="needs-translation">Geben Sie hier den Text des Inhaltselements ein. Oft können Sie diesen Text mit einem "Rich-Text-Editor" bearbeiten, der einem einfachen Textverarbeitungssystem ähnelt (siehe unten). Manchmal sehen Sie nur ein einfaches Eingabefeld, z.B. dann, wenn der Text nicht formatierbar ist. Dieses Feld wird in fast allen Inhaltstypen verwendet, so dass beim Wechsel zwischen Typen der Inhalt dieses Feldes nicht verloren ist. Sie können den Typ gefahrlos umschalten und nötigenfalls jederzeit zum alten Typ zurückschalten. &lt;b&gt;Text&lt;/b&gt; und &lt;b&gt;Text und Bilder:&lt;/b&gt; Wenn Sie als Inhaltstyp "Text" oder "Text und Bilder" wählen, ist der Inhalt normaler Text. Jeder harte Zeilenumbruch bewirkt einen neuen Absatz, Sie können das spezielle TYPO3-Tag &amp;lt;LINK&amp;gt; zur Erzeugung eines Links verwenden. Sie können auch verschiedene HTML-Tags verwenden, mit Einschränkungen. &lt;b&gt;Aufzählung:&lt;/b&gt; Wenn Sie den Typ "Aufzählung" ausgewählt haben, ist jede Zeile ein Listeneintrag. &lt;b&gt;Tabelle:&lt;/b&gt; Wenn der Typ "Tabelle" ist, so repräsentiert jede Zeile eine Tabellenzeile. Innerhalb jeder Zeile werden die Spalten durch einen vertikalen Strich getrennt: "|". Eine Tabellenzeile mit drei Spalten könnte so aussehen: "Dies ist Spalte 1 | Spalte 2 hier | Dritte Spalte!" &lt;b&gt;Skript&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Formular&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Multimedia&lt;/b&gt; und &lt;b&gt;HTML:&lt;/b&gt; Typen wie "Skript", "Formular" und "Multimedia" benutzen das Feld für Parameter, die Sie dem Element übergeben können. Und der "HTML"-Typ akzeptiert jede Eingabe als reines HTML, das ohne weitere Bearbeitung auf der Web-Seite ausgegeben wird. &lt;strong&gt;Rich Text Editor:&lt;/strong&gt; Für die Typen "Text", "Text und Bilder" und "Rich Text" wird der Rich-Text-Editor benutzt, vorausgesetzt, dass der Editor grundsätzlich aktiviert ist. Dann haben Sie eine mehr oder minder umfangreiche Werkzeugleiste zur Verfügung, um den Text zu formatieren. Alle Einschränkungen sind beabsichtigt: die &lt;b&gt;Vorlage&lt;/b&gt; ist in der Regel für Formatierung verantwortlich und so beschaffen, dass ein angemessenes, einheitliches Aussehen aller Seiten einer Website garantiert ist. Beachten Sie auch, dass der Inhalt bezüglich HTML "gereinigt" wird, bevor er in die Datenbank geschrieben wird. Ist der "Rich-Text-Editor" in Ihrem Browser nicht verfügbar, dann sehen Sie stattdessen einfaches HTML, dass Sie auch bearbeiten dürfen, wenn Sie die nötigen Kenntnisse haben. Wenden Sie sich bitte an ihre Administratoren, um, bei Bedarf, eine Grundausbildung in HTML oder den "Rich-Text-Editor" zu bekommen. &lt;b&gt;Ein Mail-Formular erstellen:&lt;/b&gt; Wenn Sie den Inhaltstyp "Formular" ausgewählt haben, sollten Sie Parameter in dieses Feld eingeben. Dies ist ein kurzes Beispiel: &lt;nobr&gt; Ihr Name: | *name=input,40 | [Name eingeben!] Ihre E-Mail-Adresse: | *email=input,40 Ihre Adresse: | adresse=textarea,40,10 Ihre Haarfarbe: |haar=radio|Blau=blau, Rot=rot |formtype_mail = submit | Formular senden |subject=hidden| Betrifft: meine Daten |html_enabled=hidden | 1 &lt;/nobr&gt; Die ersten zwei Zeilen erzeugen Eingabefelder für Name und E-Mail, beide sind mit einem "*" als "benötigt" markiert und das name-Feld hat einen Standardwert: "[Name eingeben!]". Die dritte Zeile ist ein Textfeld und die vierte Zeile erstellt Radioknöpfe für die Haarfarbe. Alle vier Zeilen haben je eine Beschriftung Am Schluss folgen drei wichtige Zeilen. Die erste erzeugt eine Sende-Schaltfläche mit der Aufschrift "Formular senden", die zweite Zeile ist der Betreff der E-Mail und die dritte Zeile sorgt dafür, dass das Ergebnis als HTML-Tabelle verschickt wird. Es ist oft einfacher, den Formularassistenten zu benutzen, klicken Sie dazu auf das Symbol rechts neben dem Eingabefeld. &lt;b&gt;Hinweis:&lt;/b&gt; Bevor ein Formular funktionieren kann, müssen Sie eine Empfängeradresse angeben. Das Feld "E-Mail-Empfänger:" ist hierfür vorgesehen (das bei anderen Typen als Untertitel benutzt wird).</target></trans-unit>

				<source>The 'Type' of content you select determines which options are available in the editing form so be sure to save the record before making other changes.

This is a description of the various types:

&lt;strong&gt;Header&lt;/strong&gt;
This type allows you to insert a standard Content Element header and nothing more.
Almost all the other types described below also include the Header and its options. The Header type provides a way to insert a header without any other content.

&lt;strong&gt;Text&lt;/strong&gt;
The Text type allows you to insert regular page content. It is generally used for text only content.

&lt;strong&gt;Text &amp; Images&lt;/strong&gt;
This is the same as the Text type (regular page content) but with the option of attaching images.

&lt;strong&gt;Image&lt;/strong&gt;
The Image type allows you to insert image only page content.

&lt;strong&gt;Bullet List&lt;/strong&gt;
Lets you create a bullet list. Each line in the text field will appear as a single bullet.

&lt;strong&gt;Table&lt;/strong&gt;
Lets you create &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; tables. Each line represents a row in the table and vertical bars ('|') separate each column. A popup wizard is also available.

&lt;strong&gt;File Links&lt;/strong&gt;
Allows you to present a list of files for download. Thumbnails can be attached to the list and you can also display the file size.

&lt;strong&gt;Form&lt;/strong&gt;
Lets you create mail forms using a special syntax or a popup wizard.

&lt;strong&gt;Search&lt;/strong&gt;
This inserts a search box and also shows the search results when a search is performed on the page.

&lt;strong&gt;Login&lt;/strong&gt;
Displays a login box for website users. This is only useful if you have already created website users and usergroups.

&lt;strong&gt;Menu/Sitemap&lt;/strong&gt;
Offers a selection of menus and a sitemap you can insert on a page.

&lt;strong&gt;Insert records&lt;/strong&gt;
This acts as placeholder for other records. With this Content Element, you can resuse multiple content elements from other pages.

&lt;strong&gt;Insert plugin&lt;/strong&gt;
This will allows you to insert news, forums, guestbooks, lists of addresses, and other functionality. Plugins are typically provided by TYPO3 extensions. The available fields and required configuration depend on the extension.

&lt;strong&gt;Divider&lt;/strong&gt;
This inserts a simple horizontal rule on a page.

&lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt;
This is plain HTML content. Anything added in the HTML Code of this Content Element will be displayed directly on the page without any preprocessing.</source>
			<target state="translated">Der "Typ" des Inhalts-Elements, den Sie auswählen, entscheidet darüber, welche Optionen Ihnen im Formular angezeigt werden. Stellen Sie sicher, dass Sie einen Datensatz sichern, nachdem Sie den Typ geändert haben und bevor Sie weitere Änderungen vornehmen. Dies ist eine Beschreibung der verschiedenen Typen: &lt;strong&gt;Überschrift&lt;/strong&gt; Dieser Typ erlaubt Ihnen ausschließlich, eine Überschrift einzufügen. Fast alle anderen Typen erlauben es ebenfalls, eine Überschrift mit genau den selben Optionen anzugeben. Der Typ "Überschrift" bietet also die Möglichkeit, eine Überschrift &lt;em&gt;ohne&lt;/em&gt; irgendetwas anderes einzufügen. &lt;strong&gt;Text&lt;/strong&gt; Der Text Typ ermöglicht die Eingabe von normalen Seiteninhalten. &lt;strong&gt;Text und Bilder&lt;/strong&gt; Dies entspricht dem Typ "Text" (normale Seiteninhalte) mit der zusätzlichen Option, Bilder anzuhängen. &lt;strong&gt;Bild&lt;/strong&gt; Das gleiche wie "Text und Bilder", aber ohne Textfeld (also nur Bilder). &lt;strong&gt;Aufzählung&lt;/strong&gt; Damit können Sie eine Aufzählung erstellen. Jede Zeile des Textfeldes erscheint als ein Punkt in einer Liste. &lt;strong&gt;Tabelle&lt;/strong&gt; Bietet die Möglichkeit, &lt;em&gt;einfache&lt;/em&gt; Tabellen zu erstellen. Jede Zeile stellt eine Tabellenzeile dar und vertikale Striche ('|') trennen die Spalten. &lt;strong&gt;Dateilinks&lt;/strong&gt; Präsentiert eine Liste von Dateien zum Herunterladen. Sie können Vorschausymbole zuordnen und die Dateigröße anzeigen lassen. &lt;strong&gt;Multimedia&lt;/strong&gt; Damit können Sie Multimediaelemente einfügen, wie z.B. Sound, Video, Java-Applets und Flash-Animationen. &lt;strong&gt;Formular&lt;/strong&gt; Lässt Sie Mail-Formulare erstellen. Für die Erstellung von Formular-Feldern gibt es eine spezielle Syntax (siehe Dokumentation). &lt;strong&gt;Suche&lt;/strong&gt; Dies fügt ein Suchfeld ein und zeigt auch das Ergebnis der Suche an, wenn diese Seite als Ziel der Suchergebnisse angegeben wird. &lt;strong&gt;Anmeldeformular&lt;/strong&gt; Zeigt eine Anmeldemaske für Website-Benutzer an. Sie müssen mindestens einen Website-Benutzer und eine Benutzergruppe anlegen, damit dieser Typ Sinn hat. &lt;strong&gt;Textbox&lt;/strong&gt; Dieser Typ ist vorgesehen für maßgeschneiderte Designs, die typisch einigen Text und ein Bild enthalten. In anderen Worten, dieser Typ ist nicht immer verfügbar. Benutzen Sie diesen Typ also nur, wenn Sie dazu angewiesen werden. Es existieren andere Typen zur Anzeige von Text und Bildern. &lt;strong&gt;Menü/Sitemap&lt;/strong&gt; Bietet eine Auswahl von verschiedenen Link-Menüs und eine Sitemap, die Sie auf einer Seite einfügen können. &lt;strong&gt;Datensatz einfügen&lt;/strong&gt; Dies ist ein Platzhalter für andere Datensätze. Mit anderen Worten: Mit diesem Element können Sie andere Datensätze von anderen Seiten anhängen und damit in diese Seite integrieren. &lt;strong&gt;Plug-In einfügen&lt;/strong&gt; Dies erlaubt es Ihnen, ein Forum, ein Gästebuch, eine Adressliste, einen Einkaufskorb etc. einzubinden. Die verschiedenen Möglichkeiten sind &lt;em&gt;nur&lt;/em&gt; dann verfügbar, wenn sie in der Vorlage richtig konfiguriert wurden. Vergewissern Sie sich also, welche Plug-Ins in Ihrer Website verfügbar sind. &lt;strong&gt;Skript&lt;/strong&gt; Dies ist reserviert für benutzerdefinierte Zwecke, womit es Ihnen der Vorlagenprogrammierer erlauben kann, spezialisierte Inhalte einzufügen. &lt;strong&gt;Trenner&lt;/strong&gt; Damit fügen Sie eine Trennlinie ein. &lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt; Dies ist reiner HTML-Inhalt. Alles, was hier eingegeben wird, wird ohne weitere Verarbeitung auf der Seite angezeigt.</target></trans-unit>

Wenn Sie "Text und Bilder" verwenden, ist es wichtig, die richtige Position des Bildblocks auszuwählen. Für diesen Zweck nutzen Sie die Positionsauswahl, die unterhalb des Textfelds gezeigt wird.

				<source>The positions above and below the body text are pretty straight forward.
The options for "In text" mean that images are displayed with text wrapped around them. When you select this option the template will probably force the images into smaller dimensions to accommodate the width of the template and the width of the text. The bodytext will float &lt;em&gt;under&lt;/em&gt; the image block when it reaches the end of the image block. In other words, the body text &lt;em&gt;wraps around&lt;/em&gt; the image block. If you select "In text" below the "No wrap" divider, the body text will not float under the image block, but simply continue in its column.
Apart from the visual difference there is a technical aspect as well. If you choose to allow the content to wrap the image block you will experience a strange phenomenon when you do not have enough bodytext to make it float around the image: subsequent content elements on the page will appear to be layered on top of the image block. However it's easily solved by changing the "In text" position to the equal value but below the "No wrap" divider.</source>
			<target state="translated">Die Positionen über und unter dem Text sind von sich aus verständlich. Die Optionen "Im Text" bedeuten, dass die Bilder vom Text umflossen werden. Wenn Sie dies auswählen, wir die Vorlage die Bilder wahrscheinlich verkleinern, weil es nicht den gleichen Raum einnehmen kann, wenn Text drum herum fließen soll. Wenn Sie "Im Text" benutzen, können Sie die Optionen oberhalb und unterhalb von "Kein Umbruch" auswählen. Wenn Sie "Im Text" oberhalb auswählen, wird der Text &lt;em&gt;unter&lt;/em&gt; dem Bilderblock weiter fließen, sobald der Text das untere Ende des Bilderblocks erreicht hat. Wenn Sie "Im Text" unter dem "Kein Umbruch"-Trenner auswählen, wird der Text nicht unter dem Bild weiter laufen, sondern in seiner Spalte bleiben. Abgesehen vom Aussehen gibt es auch einen technischen Unterschied. Wenn Sie den Text um den Bilderblock herum fließen lassen, werden Sie ein seltsames Phänomen festellen, falls Sie nicht genug Text haben, um unter dem Bild weiter zu laufen: Sie werden feststellen, dass folgende Seiteninhalte über dem Bilderblock dargestellt werden - und dies sieht wie ein Fehler aus. Dies ist einfach zu beheben, indem Sie die entsprechende Position unter dem "Kein Umbruch"-Trenner auswählen.</target></trans-unit>

&lt;strong&gt;Menu of subpages of selected pages (with abstract)&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Menu of subpages of selected pages + sections&lt;/strong&gt;
Like the previous option, but includes links to all Content Elements on the page that are marked to Show In Section Menus.

&lt;strong&gt;Sitemap&lt;/strong&gt;
Generates a classic tree sitemap. Notice that the sitemap will begin from the current page unless you select another page instead.

&lt;strong&gt;Section index (page content marked for section menus)&lt;/strong&gt;
This makes a menu of Content Elements on the selected pages for all Content Elements marked to Show In Section Menu. This is a great way to make an index at the top of the page.
If you don't want certain Content Elements to appear in the list, just uncheck the Show in Section Menus checkbox for those elements.

Hinweis: Für viele der beschriebenen Menütypen ist der Startpunkt die aktuelle Seite.

				<source>This field is used by many of the Content Element types to create a relation to either a single target page or multiple target pages. If no target page is specified, the current page will generally be used.

Using the "Search" Content Element, the target page is where search results will appear. You must make sure that this page has a similar "Search" Content Element to display the results.

The "Login" Content Element (not to be confused with the Login plugin available when the felogin extension is installed) also uses this field to redirect the login to a certain page. That page does not need to contain a "Login" Content Element in order to perform the authentication since any TYPO3 page can handle a login request.
If you specify a second page in this list, the ID will be passed to the login system as the page inside TYPO3 where website users are found. You should use this only if your template is not already configured to pass this value on.
In order for the login procedure to work you must make sure that you have created website users and website usergroups, have specified where these website users can be found (typically a SysFolder), a page ID in the page list, and ensured that cookies are enabled for the site.

The "Menu/Sitemap" Content Elements also use this field. In this case the page will determine the starting point for the menu or the actual pages shown in the menu. This behavior depends on the menu type you have selected.

Finally the "Form" element uses this field as the target page to which the form is submitted. A common use is the "Thank you" page after the form is completed.</source>
			<target state="translated">Mit diesem Feld können Sie eine Beziehung zu einer Seite (oder mehreren) in TYPO3 herstellen. Dieses Feld wird von mehreren Inhaltstypen verwendet. Wenn Sie hier keine Seite angeben, wird grundsätzlich die aktuelle Seite verwendet. Für den Typ "&lt;b&gt;Suche&lt;/b&gt;" beinhaltet das Feld die Seite, auf der das Suchergebnis angezeigt wird. Sie müssen sicherstellen, dass das Ziel ein solches "Suche"-Element (oder etwas ähnliches) besitzt, um das Ergebnis darzustellen. Ansonsten ist es nicht sinnvoll. Das Element "&lt;b&gt;Anmeldeformular&lt;/b&gt;" benutzt dies Feld ebenfalls, um den angemeldeten Benutzer auf eine neue Seite zu umzuleiten. Dieses Ziel benötigt allerdings kein Anmeldeformularelement, um die Anmeldung durchzuführen - Sie können den Anwender auf jede beliebige TYPO3-Seite weiterleiten! Wenn Sie in der Liste eine zweiter Seite angeben, so wird diese Seite an das Anmeldesystem als diejenige Seite weitergeleitet, wo die Datenbank der Anwender zu finden ist. Sie sollten dies nur verwenden, wenn Ihre Vorlage diesen Wert nicht von sich aus weiterleitet. Damit die Anmeldung funktioniert, müssen Sie sicherstellen, dass 1) Sie einen Benutzer und eine Benutzergruppe erstellt haben, 2) Sie in der Vorlage definiert haben, auf welcher Seite (typisch ein SysOrdner) die Benutzer gefunden werden können - oder sie haben dies durch die zweite Seite in der Seitenliste getan, 3) Cookies im Browser des Anwenders aktiviert sind. Der Inhaltstyp "&lt;b&gt;Menü/Sitemap&lt;/b&gt;" benutzt dieses Feld ebenfalls. In diesem Fall wird damit spezifiziert, von welcher Seite aus das Menü erzeugt wird oder enthält sogar diejenigen Seiten, auf die das Menü verweist. All dies hängt vom ausgewählten Untertyp ab. Schließlich benutzt das Element "&lt;b&gt;Formular&lt;/b&gt;" dieses Feld als Angabe, welche Seite nach Absenden des Formulars angezeigt wird.
